# Blinkit-Analytics-report-using-SQL


⭐ Useful Summary

This SQL project analyzes negative customer feedback to identify recurring delivery and product issues. The query filters all feedback with ratings below 3 and highlights only those problems that occur more than five times in a month. By grouping results by month, feedback category, and feedback text, the output reveals the most common issues customers face.

The analysis helps teams quickly understand trends such as frequent delivery delays, product quality complaints, and seasonal spikes in negative feedback. This information supports data-driven decisions for improving delivery efficiency, packaging quality, and overall customer experience.
